# VTOL Drone Project (Rynx)

I started this project to understand how real drones work — not just simulations.

Current goal:
→ Build a working quadplane VTOL system from scratch

Status:
- Frame design: Not finalized
- Flight controller: Learning phase
- Simulation: Planned
- Hardware: Not purchased yet

Why I'm building this:
I want to move into aerospace / robotics and eventually build advanced autonomous systems.

What I know:
- Basic Python
- Basic electronics (learning)

What I don't know (yet):
- Flight control tuning
- PX4 / ArduPilot setup
- Sensor fusion
to be contuined 
more changes soon ig
